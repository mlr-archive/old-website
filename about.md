## The Package

[**mlr**](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr) is our *R* package to make *machine learning in R* easy for you and for us.
Trying out and comparing different machine learning methods in *R* was always a tedious task as you had to check every documentation to see how each function is called.
And not even the output is directly comparable.
Worry no more!
**mlr** has you covered: **cross-validation**, **variable selection**, **tuning** and many more can be easily done with **mlr** and a standardized interface!

## The Blog

This blog is the platform for some *R* developers, statisticians and data scientists to post hopefully interesting bits of knowledge about *machine learning*.
In one way or another we all contributed to **mlr** and want to present you some **highlights**, **hints** and **insights** of **mlr**.
We try to post neat stuff we learned and we want to promote on an irregular basis.


## The Contributors

All **mlr developers** are listed [here](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr/wiki/mlr-developer-team-and-contributors-page).

### Blog Authors

#### Michel Lang

I am PostDoc at the Statistics Department at the University Dortmund.
I work on parallelization, hyperparameter optimization and survival analysis.
More information can be found at my [website](https://www.statistik.tu-dortmund.de/lang00.html) or [GitHub](https://github.com/mllg).

#### Jakob Richter

Hi, I am a PhD candidate working full time at [TU Dortmund](https://www.statistik.tu-dortmund.de/richter.html) for the [SFB 876](http://sfb876.tu-dortmund.de/).
There we focus on *Resource-Constraint Data Analysis*.
My research interests are *hyperparameter optimization*, *model based optimization* ([mlrMBO](https://github.com/berndbischl/mlrMBO)) and both in combination.
For the latter we develop new algorithms focused especially on resource awareness.
You can check out my contributions on [my github](https://github.com/jakob-r) and check out my irregularly updated [blog](https://jakob-r.github.io).

#### Bernd Bischl

I am professor of computational statistics at the LMU Munich and created mlr a long time ago.
Go to my [personal page](http://berndbischl.github.io/) for any further info on me.

#### Philipp Probst

I am a PhD Student in statistics and machine learning at IBE, LMU Munich.
My research interests cover tree-based methods and ensemble techniques, hyperparameters of ML algorithms, benchmark experiments and multilabel classification.
More information about me and some other blog posts can be found at my [blog](http://philipppro.github.io/).

#### Zachary Jones

I am a graduate student at Pennsylvania State University where I work on methods for interpreting
statistical learning methods, dependent data, latent variable models for networks, and applications of these
methods in the social sciences. More information is on my [website](http://zmjones.com).

#### Mason Gallo

I am a graduate student at Georgia Tech with industry experience in machine learning. In addition
to my research and open-source work, I am also passionate about training and education. Go to
my [personal page](http://masongallo.github.io/) to learn more about me.

#### Heidi Seibold

I am a PhD candidate in Biostatistics at the Universtiy of Zurich 
([EBPI](http://www.ebpi.uzh.ch/en/aboutus/people.html)).
My research is on model-based recursive partitioning in the context of clinical trials.
More information on my research is on my [website](http://www.ebpi.uzh.ch/en/aboutus/departments/biostatistics/teambiostats/seibold.html).
I organize the [Zurich R User meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Zurich-R-User-Group/) and write a 
[blog](http://heidiseibold.github.io/). 

#### Janek Thomas

I am a PhD student in the working group computational statistics at the Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich.
Most on my work is on hyperparameter tuning, variable selection and gradient boosting.
