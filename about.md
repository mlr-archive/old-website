## The Package

[**mlr**](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr) is our *R* package to make *machine learning in R* easy for you and for us.
Trying out and comparing different machine learning methods in *R* was always a tedious task as you had to check every documentation to see how each function is called.
And not even the output is directly comparable.
Worry no more!
**mlr** has you covered: **cross-validation**, **variable selection**, **tuning** and many more can be easily done with **mlr** and a standardized interface!

## The Blog

This blog is the platform for some *R* developers, statisticians and data scientists to post hopefully interesting bits of knowledge about *machine learning*.
In one way or another we all contributed to **mlr** and want to present you some **highlights**, **hints** and **insights** of **mlr**.
We try to post neat stuff we learned and we want to promote on an irregular basis.


## The Contributors

All **mlr developers** are listed [here](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr/wiki/mlr-developer-team-and-contributors-page).

### Blog Authors

#### Michel Lang

I am PostDoc at the Statistics Department at the University Dortmund.
I work on parallelization, hyperparameter optimization and survival analysis.
More information can be found at my [website](https://www.statistik.tu-dortmund.de/lang00.html) or [GitHub](https://github.com/mllg).

#### Jakob Richter

Hi, I am a PhD candidate working full time at [TU Dortmund](https://www.statistik.tu-dortmund.de/richter.html) for the [SFB 876](http://sfb876.tu-dortmund.de/).
There we focus on *Resource-Constraint Data Analysis*.
My research interests are *hyperparameter optimization*, *model based optimization* ([mlrMBO](https://github.com/berndbischl/mlrMBO)) and both in combination.
For the latter we develop new algorithms focused especially on resource awareness.
You can check out my contributions on [my github](https://github.com/jakob-r) and check out my irregularly updated [blog](https://jakob-r.github.io).
